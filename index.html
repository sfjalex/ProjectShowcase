    <h2>Certifaction</h2>
    <p>
    Certifaction is a full stack marketplace website built with SQL, HTML, CSS, Java, and runs using Docker. 
    This project was built in a collaborative setting that encouraged communication and constant innovation.
    It also featured a large number of robust features such as basic login, sign-up, and logout functionality and viewable products that can be filtered, and searched for.
    As well, each product individually had its own page that displayed a description, image, and user reviews that could be added by any given logged-in user.
    The product pages lead to checkout pages and there is also an admin portal to view transactions, warehouse stock, and sales graphs.
    This project required through understanding of databases and communcation skills to work well in a group setting.
