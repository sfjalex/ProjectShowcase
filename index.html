    <h2>Certifaction</h2>
    <p>
         Certifaction is a full stack marketplace website built with SQL, HTML, CSS, Java, and runs using Docker. 
         This project was built in a collaborative setting that encouraged communication and constant innovation.
         It also featured a large number of robust features such as basic login, sign-up, and logout functionality and viewable products that can be filtered, and searched for.
         As well, each product individually had its own page that displayed a description, image, and user reviews that could be added by any given logged-in user.
         The product pages lead to checkout pages and there is also an admin portal to view transactions, warehouse stock, and sales graphs.
         This project required through understanding of databases and communcation skills to work well in a group setting.

    <h2>JustOKRides</h2>

    <p>
        JustOKRides is a prototype of a potential ride share or carpooling app that is heavily focused on the user interface and obtaining user input. 
        This project that is currently being developed in a group setting involves the use and experimentation with multiple different forms of requirments gathering, using semi-structured and unstructured interviews to better understand, simplify, and apply prospective users needs to the prototype.
        A heavy emphasis on user interaction is incorporated into the development of the prototype which leads to the use of tools such as Figma in order to create interactable and iterable wireframe prototypes of the app.
        As such, this project pushed for a greater understanding of a given user base and how to cater to their needs and wants to make a cohesive and understandable UI and of course how to convey these ideas and collaborate in a team.

    </div>
    <p>Current Developement Look:</p>

    <p>
        Task Manager is a full stack task management website that allows a user to add, delete, and manipulate tasks that they can self-assign or have admins assign them.
        As well, a user can send messages, create chats with other users, and has global authentication using website cookies.
        This project is also done in a collaborative setting and is built with TypeScript, React JS, Node JS, Next JS, JEST for testing, and CSS.
        The website is still being developed, but it has pushed me to learn whole new coding languages and systems which have vastly broadend my skill set.
        For the group style it is built around the Agile developement cycle, including stand-up meetings, Kanban boards, and scrum meetings to conform to the developement style.
